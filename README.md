# Examples

```csharp
public class ExampleQuerySystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .WithAll<PlayerComponent, ViewComponent, Reference<Transform>>()
            .WithNone<Dead>()
            .ForEach((Entity entity, ref PlayerComponent player, ref ViewComponent viewComponent) =>
            {
                player.value++;
            });
    }
}
```

```csharp
public class CustomSequentialJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        var jobHandle = CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();

        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallelAfterwards>(jobHandle);
    }
}
```

# Comparison & Performance

## Before

Usually, the regular system in Morpeh is implemented this way:

```csharp
public class NoQueriesTestSystem : UpdateSystem
{
    private Filter filter;

    public override void OnAwake()
    {
        filter = World.Filter.With<TestComponent>();
    }

    public override void OnUpdate(float deltaTime)
    {
        foreach (var entity in filter)
        {
            ref var testQueryComponent = ref entity.GetComponent<TestComponent>();
            testQueryComponent.value++;
        }
    }
}
```

There will be `1 000 000` entities and `100` iterations of testing for this and the other examples;

Results: **14.43** seconds.

In order to optimize this, we can store a reference to the `Stash<T>` that contains all the components of type `TestComponent` for different entities:

```csharp
public class NoQueriesUsingStashTestSystem : UpdateSystem
{
    private Filter filter;
    private Stash<TestComponent> stash;

    public override void OnAwake()
    {
        filter = World.Filter.With<TestComponent>();
        stash = World.GetStash<TestComponent>();
    }

    public override void OnUpdate(float deltaTime)
    {
        foreach (var entity in filter)
        {
            ref var testQueryComponent = ref stash.Get(entity);
            testQueryComponent.value++;
        }
    }
}
```

Results: **9.05** seconds (-38%)

## After

In order to remove the boilerplate for acquiring the components and still have it optimized using Stashes, you can use the Queries from this plugin instead: 

```csharp
public class WithQueriesSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ForEach((Entity entity, ref TestComponent testQueryComponent) =>
            {
                testQueryComponent.value++;
            });
    }
}
```

Results: **9.45** seconds (+5%)

As you can see, we're using a `QuerySystem` abstract class that implements the queries inside, therefore we have no `OnUpdate` method anymore. If you need the `deltaTime` though, you can acquire it using `protected float deltaTime` field in `QuerySystem`, which is updated every time `QuerySystem.OnUpdate()` is called.

Performance-wise, it's a bit slower than the optimized solution that we've looked previously (because of using lambdas), but still faster that the "default" one and is **much** smaller than both of them.

## After (using Burst)

In order to optimize it even further, one can use burst jobs. Firstly, let's create a job:

```csharp
[BurstCompile]
public struct CustomTestJobParallel : IJobParallelFor
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeFilter entities;

    public NativeStash<TestComponent> testComponentStash;

    public void Execute(int index)
    {
        var entityId = entities[index];
        ref var component = ref testComponentStash.Get(entityId, out var exists);
        if (exists)
        {
            component.value++;
        }
    }
}
```

Now we should create a system that will run the job. Let's check how it's done using Morpeh:

```csharp
public class NoQueriesUsingStashJobsTestSystem : UpdateSystem
{
    private Filter filter;
    private Stash<TestComponent> stash;

    public override void OnAwake()
    {
        filter = World.Filter.With<TestComponent>();
        stash = World.GetStash<TestComponent>();
    }

    public override void OnUpdate(float deltaTime)
    {
        var nativeFilter = filter.AsNative();
        var parallelJob = new CustomTestJobParallel
        {
            entities = nativeFilter,
            testComponentStash = stash.AsNative()
        };
        var parallelJobHandle = parallelJob.Schedule(nativeFilter.length, 64);
        parallelJobHandle.Complete();
    }
}
```

Results: `1.67` seconds (-83%). 

Jobs are much faster, as you can see, but it requires even more preparations. Let's remove this boilerplate by using this plugin:

```csharp
public class CustomJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();
    }
}
```

Results: `1.69` seconds (+1%).

This approach uses `Reflections API` to fill in all the required parameters in the job (`NativeFilter` & `NativeStash<T>`), but the code is well optimized and it affects performance very slightly. Supports as many stashes as you want to. 

# Queries

## Creating a query

You should define all the queries inside `Configure` method.

`CreateQuery()` returns an object of type `QueryBuilder` that has many overloads for filtering that you can apply before describing the `ForEach` lambda. 

You can also **combine multiple filtering** calls in a sequence before describing the `ForEach` lambda:

```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .WithAll<TestComponent, DamageComponent>()
    .WithNone<Dead, Inactive>()
    .ForEach(...)
```

## .WithAll

Selects all the entities that have **all** of the specified components.

```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .WithAll<TestComponent, DamageComponent>()
    .ForEach(...)
CreateQuery()
    .WithAll<TestComponent, DamageComponent, PlayerComponent, ViewComponent>()
    .ForEach(...)
```

Supports up to 8 arguments (but you can extend it if you want).

Equivalents in Morpeh:
```csharp
Filter = Filter.With<TestComponent>().With<DamageComponent>();
Filter = Filter.With<TestComponent>().With<DamageComponent>().With<PlayerComponent>().With<ViewComponent>();
```

## .WithNone

Selects all the entities that have **none** of the specified components.

```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .WithNone<Dead, Inactive>()
    .ForEach(...)
CreateQuery()
    .WithNone<Dead, Inactive, PlayerComponent, ViewComponent>()
    .ForEach(...)
```

Supports up to 8 arguments (but you can extend it if you want).

Equivalents in Morpeh:
```csharp
Filter = Filter.Without<Dead>().Without<Inactive>();
Filter = Filter.Without<Dead>().Without<Inactive>().Without<PlayerComponent>().Without<ViewComponent>();
```

## .With<T>

Equivalent to Morpeh's `Filter.With<T>`.

## .Without<T>

Equivalent to Morpeh's `Filter.Without<T>`.

## .Also

You can specify your custom filter if you want:
```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .WithAll<TestComponent, DamageComponent>()
    .Also(filter => filter.Without<T>())
    .ForEach(...)
```

## .ForEach

There are multiple supported options for describing a lambda:

```csharp
.ForEach<TestComponent>(ref TestComponent component)
.ForEach<TestComponent>(Entity entity, ref TestComponent component)
```

You can either receive the entity as the 1st parameter or you can just skip it if you only need the components.

Supported up to 8 components (you can extend it if you want)

**Restrictions**

* You can only receive components as **ref**
* You can't receive Aspects

## .ForEachParallel

Same as `ForEach`, but utilizes `System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.ForEach` to run the query in multiple threads (same amount as user's CPU cores).

The system will wait until the ForEachParallel finishes. If you want to have async calculations for your system, please use [Jobs & Burst](#jobs--burst)

## .ForAll

Instead of specifying a lambda for each entity that will be processed, you can specify lambda that will be executed once for each update:

```csharp
.ForAll()
.ForAll(Filter filter)
```

# Events

## Getting started

In order to start using Events, you should enable Event's feature for your world:

```csharp
world = World.Create();
world.EnableFeature<EventsFeature>();
```

## Scheduling Events

### .ScheduleEvent

You can schedule an event that will be distributed among all the listener systems during the next frame and will be deleted automatically afterwards. In order to do so, call `this.ScheduleEvent` inside `IQuerySystem` or `World.ScheduleEvent` inside `ISystem`:

```csharp
World.ScheduleEvent(new TestWorldEvent
{
    value = 1
});
```

When scheduling the event this way, you're creating one instance of this event that is not connected to any Entity in your world. Basically, this is considered as a World Event.

### .ScheduleEventForEntity

You can schedule an event that will connected to specified Entity and be distributed among all the listener systems during the next frame and will be deleted automatically afterwards. In order to do so, call `this.ScheduleEventForEntity` inside `IQuerySystem` or `World.ScheduleEventForEntity` inside `ISystem`:

```csharp
this.ScheduleEventForEntity(entity, new TestWorldEvent
{
    value = 1
});
```

This way, you're creating an instance of this event that is linked to the entity you've specified.

## Receiving Events

### .CreateEventListener

You can subscribe to world events by using `CreateEventListener`:

```csharp
this.CreateEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
```

### .ForAll

If you want to receive list of events that were distributed this frame:

```csharp
this.CreateEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
    .ForAll(events =>
    {
        foreach (var eventData in events)
        {
            ...
        }
    });
```

### .ForEach

If you want to receive a world event one by one:

```csharp
this.CreateEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
    .ForEach(eventData => { summarizedValue += eventData.value; });
```

There are also many overrides to this function that allows you to receive the Entity and it's components at the same time:

```csharp
this.CreateEntityEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
    .ForEach((Entity entity, TestWorldEvent testWorldEvent, ref TestComponent testComponent) =>
    {
        testComponent.value += 1;
    });

this.CreateEntityEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
    .ForEach((Entity entity, ref TestComponent testComponent) =>
    {
        testComponent.value += 1;
    });

this.CreateEntityEventListener<TestWorldEvent>()
    .ForEach(entity =>
    {
        testComponent.value += 1;
    });
```

If you're expecting a component that the Entity that received the event doesn't have -> ForEach won't be triggered for this entity!

# Jobs & Burst

To optimize the performance of your application, consider utilizing Unity's Jobs system and Burst technology to execute calculations in the background while running a query instead of executing them on the main thread. You can find examples of using Jobs in this chapter.

## QuerySystem.ScheduleJob (IJob)

If you want to schedule a job which will run once on every update, you can use this:

```csharp
public class WaitJobSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        this.ScheduleJob<WaitJob>();
    }
}
```

If you need to initialize your job somehow on every update, use preparation delegate:
```csharp
public class WaitJobSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        this.ScheduleJob((ref WaitJob job) =>
        {
            job.millis = 10;
        });
    }
}
```

###Query.ScheduleJob (IJobParallelFor)

If you want to schedule a job which will be able to iterate through entities that your query is selecting, use `QueryBuilder.ScheduleJob<YourJobType>` to schedule it. 

All the fields (`NativeFilter` & `NativeStash<T>`) will be injected automatically!

Example

```csharp
[BurstCompile]
public struct CustomTestJobParallel : IJobParallelFor
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeFilter entities;

    public NativeStash<TestComponent> testComponentStash;

    public void Execute(int index)
    {
        var entityId = entities[index];
        ref var component = ref testComponentStash.Get(entityId, out var exists);
        if (exists)
        {
            component.value++;
        }
    }
}

public class CustomJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();
    }
}
```

Results: ~1.6 seconds (`1 000 000` entities & `100` iterations)

Supports as many NativeStash's as you want.

## Scheduling Parallel Jobs

You can schedule multiple jobs in one system as well:

```csharp
public class CustomParallelJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();

        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallelValue2>();
    }
}
```

They will be executed in parallel.

### Waiting for previous or inner jobs to finish

By default, `QuerySystem` won't wait until all the previous and/or inner jobs are completed, but will delegate this logic to the `World.JobHandle` instead. In this case, the world will wait for all the jobs in all the systems to be finished. 

However, you can change this behaviour by using `WaitUntilInnerJobsCompleted` and/or `WaitUntilPreviousJobsCompleted`:

```csharp
public class CustomSequentialJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        // let's wait until all the previous jobs (from previous systems) are finished
        WaitUntilPreviousJobsCompleted();
        
        // let's schedule first job
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();
        
        // scheduling another job that will be run in parallel with the 1st
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<AnotherParallelCustomTestJobParallel>();
        
        // let's wait until both jobs that we created to be finished before proceeding to the next system
        WaitUntilInnerJobsCompleted();
    }
}
```

## Waiting for another job to finish

You can also force one job to be dependent on another (to only execute when the 1st is finished):

```csharp
public class CustomSequentialJobQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        var jobHandle = CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallel>();

        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ScheduleJob<CustomTestJobParallelValue2>(jobHandle);
    }
}
```

## .ForEachNative

You can also just receive the native filter & stashes if you want to do your custom logic.

```csharp
[BurstCompile]
public struct CustomTestJobParallel : IJobParallelFor
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeFilter entities;

    public NativeStash<TestComponent> testComponentStash;

    public void Execute(int index)
    {
        var entityId = entities[index];
        ref var component = ref testComponentStash.Get(entityId, out var exists);
        if (exists)
        {
            component.value++;
        }
    }
}

public class CustomJobsQueriesTestSystem : QuerySystem
{
    protected override void Configure()
    {
        CreateQuery()
            .With<TestComponent>()
            .ForEachNative((NativeFilter entities, NativeStash<TestComponent> testComponentStash) =>
            {
                var parallelJob = new CustomTestJobParallel
                {
                    entities = entities,
                    testComponentStash = testComponentStash
                };
                var parallelJobHandle = parallelJob.Schedule(entities.length, 64);
                parallelJobHandle.Complete();
            });
    }
}
```

Results: ~2.40 seconds (`1 000 000` entities & `100` iterations)

Supports up to `6` arguments (you can extend it if you want).

# Additions

## Automatic Validation

Be default, the query engine applies checks when you create a query: all the components that you're using in `ForEach` should also be defined in a query using `With` or `WithAll` to guarantee that the components exist on the entities that the resulting `Filter` returns.

This validation **only happens once** when creating a query so it doesn't affect the performance of your `ForEach` method! 

However, if you're willing to disable the validation for some reason, you can use `.SkipValidation(true)` method:

```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .WithAll<TestComponent, DamageComponent>()
    .SkipValidation(true)
    .ForEach(...)
```

## Globals

If you want to specify that ALL of your queries should only process entities that have component `X` or don't process entities that have component `Y`, you can use globals feature:

```csharp
QueryBuilderGlobals.With<X>();
QueryBuilderGlobals.Without<Y>();
```

Be careful with using globals though - you might have difficult time debugging your systems :)

Make sure you set this before any systems get initialized (once `CreateQuery()` is converted to lambda or job, the filter is not mutable anymore!).

You can also disable globals for specific queries by using `.IgnoreGlobals(true)`:

```csharp
CreateQuery()
    .With<TestComponent>()
    .IgnoreGlobals(true)
    .ForEach((Entity entity, ref TestComponent testQueryComponent) =>
    {
        testQueryComponent.value++;
    });
```

## OnAwake & OnUpdate

You can override `OnAwake` & `OnUpdate` methods of `QuerySystem` if you want to:

```charp
public override void OnAwake()
{
    base.OnAwake();
}

public override void OnUpdate(float newDeltaTime)
{
    base.OnUpdate(newDeltaTime);
}
```

Don't forget to call the base method, otherwise `Configure` and/or queries execution won't happen!

## Custom systems that don't extend QuerySystem

If you have your own systems that extend `ISystem` and you don't want to inherit `QuerySystem` class, you can just implement interface `IQuerySystem` and implement the logic of executing the lambdas yourself.
